        <h2> Dear Pawwrushii </h2>
        <p>I still remember the night we had our first conversation. It was such a good one (mostly because of me, obviously ðŸ¤­).</p>
    <p>But seriously, thank you for being awake that night, and thank you for not skipping me.</p>
    <p>You went from being a stranger to an important part of my life so quickly, and Iâ€™m truly grateful for that. Grateful for your existence (chane ke jhaad par hee chadh jaoge ab ðŸ˜–).</p>
    <p>Thank you for keeping up with me. Thank you for tolerating me. Thank you for everything.</p>
    <p>I donâ€™t really know what else to say now... because I donâ€™t have any more words to explain or justify how important you are to me.</p>
    <p>I never said this before, but you are <strong>SPECIAL</strong> to me, like the Kohinoor to Elizabeth, like adrak ka swaad to a Bandar.</p>
    <h3>So, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BESTIEEE ðŸ‘µðŸŽ‰</h3>
